MVC
===

The guts and insides of the MVC project that supports Kartessian.

The content explaining why it works and how is being done is in the [Wiki](https://github.com/Kartessian/MVC/wiki)



Kartessian was created as a solution to improve the experience about data visualization over a mapping engine. Its was initially developed using the Google Maps Javascript API and later made it compatible with Mapbox Javascript API, though that was the original intention.

This repository does not contain the full source code of the project, but contains information and examples about how it works and how things are done the way they are.
